Some advantages of generating code that goes through an Objective-C compiler:

- The Objective-C compiler does some checks for you.
- The Objective-C can do all its linking trickery with selectors.
- You can easily reference static variables or methods.
- It should be more easy to create new classes without needing manual registration.
